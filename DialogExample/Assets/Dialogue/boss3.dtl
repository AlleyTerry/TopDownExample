Charlie: I can do better!
[signal arg="end"]
How do you contribute to the bottom line?
Charlie: I-
- I will work even harder.
- I can get everyone producing more work!
We need millions. Youâ€™re not an investor
- Give me another chance
- I can still grow!
We'll see if you are chosen for redundancy or not later.
