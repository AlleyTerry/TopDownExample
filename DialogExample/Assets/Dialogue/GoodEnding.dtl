Sarah: Charlie! You’re awake!!
Charlie: Where am I?
Sarah: You’ve been in a coma, Charlie! I’m so glad you’re awake!
Charlie: A coma? My job, is my job okay?
Sarah: Don’t worry Charlie, but everything is fine, you still have your job!
It’s remarkable, your stats have rebalanced… It’s like you were fixing the alchemy of your mind whilst you were asleep!
Charlie: Haha, something like that…
