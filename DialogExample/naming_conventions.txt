Use snake_case for file names. For named classes, convert the PascalCase class name to snake_case:
# This file should be saved as `weapon.gd`.
class_name Weapon
extends Node

# This file should be saved as `yaml_parser.gd`.
class_name YAMLParser
extends Object

---

Use PascalCase for class and node names:
extends CharacterBody3D

Also use PascalCase when loading a class into a constant or a variable:
const Weapon = preload("res://weapon.gd")

---

Functions and variables¶
Use snake_case to name functions and variables:

var particle_effect
func load_level():

---

Use the past tense to name signals:
signal door_opened
signal score_changed

---

Constants and enums¶
Write constants with CONSTANT_CASE, that is to say in all caps with an underscore (_) to separate words:
const MAX_SPEED = 200
Use PascalCase for enum names and CONSTANT_CASE for their members, as they are constants:

enum Element {
	EARTH,
	WATER,
	AIR,
	FIRE,
}
